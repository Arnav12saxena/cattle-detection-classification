# 🐄 Indian Cattle Breed Identification using YOLOv8x + EfficientNetV2-S  
### 🧬 A Two-Stage Computer Vision Pipeline for Fine-Grained Breed Classification

This project presents a two-stage deep learning pipeline for **automatic identification of Indian indigenous cattle breeds** from real-world farm images.  
It integrates:

- **YOLOv8x (COCO-pretrained)** for cattle region extraction  
- **EfficientNetV2-S** for fine-grained breed classification  

Despite severe dataset issues and minimal high-quality crops, the classifier achieves:

- **Top-1 Accuracy:** ~78%  
- **Top-5 Accuracy:** ~98%  
- **Macro F1-Score:** ~0.78

# 📌 Introduction

Breed identification plays a critical role in:

- Livestock productivity  
- Feeding and breeding optimization  
- Genetic conservation  
- Health monitoring  

However, India’s bovine datasets suffer from:

- Mixed cattle and buffalo species  
- Non-standardized backgrounds  
- High intra-class variation  
- Very similar-looking breeds  
- Partial-body images  
- Class imbalance  

This project addresses these issues through a **two-stage workflow**:

### 🐮 YOLOv8x (COCO pretrained)  
Used only as a detector to crop cattle from raw images.

### 🌾 EfficientNetV2-S  
Fine-tuned for multi-class Indian cattle breed classification.

This is one of the few experimental works focusing on **Indian indigenous breeds**.

---

# 🎯 Experimental Objective

The goal was to build a robust end-to-end pipeline that can:

- Detect cattle in real-world images  
- Generate consistent YOLO-based crops  
- Classify breeds using EfficientNetV2-S  
- Handle non-ideal conditions  
- Test feasibility of field deployment  

### ⚠️ Not Attempted: Body Condition Score (BCS)  
BCS requires side-view images, pose estimation, and labeled BCS datasets.  
These were not available.

# 🗂 Dataset Description

### 📥 Source  
Kaggle: **Indian Bovine Breeds Dataset**  
Contains both cattle and buffalo images.

### ⚠️ Raw Dataset Problems
- Mixed buffalo and cow species  
- Class imbalance  
- Partial-body visibility  
- Real-world farm backgrounds  
- High inter-breed similarity  
- Inconsistent viewpoints  

### 🧹 Final Dataset After Cleaning
- Buffalo classes removed  
- 16 cattle breeds retained  
- YOLO crops generated using `yolov8x.pt`  
- Crops manually verified  

### 📊 Final Image Split
| Split | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Train | 2176 |
| Validation | 625 |
| Test | 318 |

# 🔧 Methodology

## 🐮 Stage 1 — YOLOv8x Detection

YOLOv8x COCO was used **without retraining**:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
detector = YOLO("yolov8x.pt")
```

### 🔍 Key Observations

- COCO has only **one generic cow class**  
- Indian breeds vary drastically  
- ~0.5% successful detections on raw dataset  
- Frequent detection failures:
  - Head-only detections  
  - Missed animals  
  - False positives  

Even so, enough clean crops were gathered.

## 🌾 Stage 2 — EfficientNetV2-S Classification

### ⚙️ Training Configuration
- Input: 256×256  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy  
- Batch size: 16–32  

### 🚀 Two-Phase Training

#### 🔵 Phase 1 — Feature Adaptation (12 epochs)
- Higher LR  
- Adapt pretrained backbone  

#### 🟢 Phase 2 — Fine-Tuning (15 epochs)
- Lower LR  
- Reduced overfitting  
- Stable convergence
